msgstr ""

#: ../../Apache.rst:13
msgid ""
"The \"assbackwards\" way (the default one). It is the fastest but "
"somewhat far from the Apache2 API. If you do not use Apache2 filters "
"(including gzip) for content generated by uWSGI, use this mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Apache.rst:15

"The \"cgi\" mode. This one is somewhat slower but better integrated with "
"Apache. To use the CGI mode, pass ``-C`` to the uWSGI server."

"This is the latest module and probably the best bet for the future.  It "
"is a \"proxy\" module, so you will get all of the features exported by "
"mod_proxy.  It is fully \"apache api compliant\" so it should be easy to "
"integrate with the available modules.  Using it is easy; just remember to"
" load mod_proxy and mod_proxy_uwsgi modules in your apache config."

#: ../../Apache.rst:67
msgid ""
"The first two forms set SCRIPT_NAME respectively to /foo and /bar while "
"the last one use an empty SCRIPT_NAME. You can set additional uwsgi vars "
"using the SetEnv directive and load balance requests using "
"mod_proxy_balancer."

#: ../../Apache.rst:79
msgid ""
"Pay attention to the last slash in the member/node definition. It is "
"optional for non-empty SCRIPT_NAME/mountpoints but required for apps "
"mounted in the root of the domain.  Currently the module lacks the "
"ability to set modifiers, though this will be fixed soon. An alternative "
"is to set the plugin you want to use as the first one (0):"

"Starting from Apache 2.4.9, support for Unix sockets has been added. The "

msgid ""
"As per apache documentation, the hostname part of the proxy address is "
"ignored. However, if one wants to have different sockets for different "
"apps within the same apache instance, the proxy address is used by apache"
" to identify different proxy workers: if the proxy address is the same, "
"only the firstly declared unix domain socket will get a worker and the "
"secondly declared app will have no worker and won't be reachable. A "
"workaround this apache limitation (bug?) is to use different hostnames."
