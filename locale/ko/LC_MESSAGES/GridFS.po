"Beginning in uWSGI 1.9.5 a \"GridFS\" plugin is available. It exports "
"both a request handler and an internal routing function.  Its official "
"modifier is '25'. The routing instruction is \"gridfs\" The plugin is "
"written in C++."

"To build the plugin you need the ``libmongoclient`` headers (and a "

#: ../../GridFS.rst:70
msgid ""
"Generally ``PATH_INFO`` is prefixed with a '/'. This could cause problems"
