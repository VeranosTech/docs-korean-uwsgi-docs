"The matheval support has been removed, while a generic \"matheval\" "
"plugin (for internal routing) is available (but not compiled in by "
"default). See below for the new way for making \"math\" in config files."

"The \"erlang\" and \"pyerl\" plugins are broken and has been moved out of"

"The ZeroMQ API (a single function indeed) will be removed. Each plugin "
"using ZeroMQ will create its own ``zmq`` context (no need to share it). "
"This means libzmq will no more be linked in the uWSGI core binary."
