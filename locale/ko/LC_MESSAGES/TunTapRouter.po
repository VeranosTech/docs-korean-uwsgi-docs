"The TunTap router is an ad-hoc solution for giving network connectivity "
"to Linux processes running in a dedicated network namespace. Well "
"obviously it has other uses, but very probably this is the most "
"interesting one, and the one for which it was developed. Currently it "
"builds only on Linux platforms."
