"uWSGI supports a configurable number of locks you can use to synchronize "
"worker processes.  Lock 0 (zero) is always available, but you can add "
"more with the ``locks`` option.  If your app has a lot of critical areas,"
" holding and releasing the same lock over and over again can kill "
"performance."
