"Finally you are able to override the uWSGI processing model to completely"
" get control of it. This is very similar to what you can do in projects "
"like gunicorn (and its integration with tornado or gevent). Obviously "
"native plugins are still the best approach (they allow integration with "
"uWSGI api and states), but in some case you may want to use uWSGI process"
" management facilities and let your app do the rest of the work."
